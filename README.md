# NBA Player Performance Prediction

## üìñ Project Overview
The **NBA Player Performance Prediction** app forecasts key player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, rebounds) for upcoming NBA seasons using historical data. This predictive tool empowers NBA team owners and fantasy team managers to make structured, strategic decisions.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Data Preparation:** Organizes and cleans historical NBA player statistics.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifies patterns and trends in player performances over multiple seasons.
- **Model Implementation:** Uses machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation:** Model accuracy assessed via Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Player Clustering:** Groups players based on statistical similarities to identify meaningful categories.
- **Graph Networks:** Visualizes player relationships and statistical similarities using interactive graph networks.
